\details{
Calculate Volume using the British Columbia Ministry of Forests and Range (2009) formula
CWD volume (m3/ha) = pi^2/8L  *  sum\link{D2/cos (A)}
Where: 	L = length of total transect (horizontal distance (HD) in m)
HD = SD / Square root of \link{1 + (\% slope / 100)2}
slope was not measured so assume total transect length to be 90m
D = diameter of each piece of CWD (cm)
A = tilt angle from horizontal for each piece (degrees)
Because tilt angle was not measured in 1992 and 1993, it was assumed to be zero,
so that cos (A) = 1 for all pieces in those years.
