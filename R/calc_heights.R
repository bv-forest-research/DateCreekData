#'
#' @param dat
#' @param lrg_trees_2010 where is the 2010 data - this is where tree ids are flagged as planted or not
#' @param planted_hgt Specify the height cutoff (also need to specify species) to use to determine
#' whether the tree is less than a certain diameter and therefore planted
#' (requires specifying sp_plant as well)
#' @param planted_diam Specify the diameter cutoff to use to determine whether the tree
#' is less than a certain diameter and therefore planted
#' @param sp_plant which species was planted and expected to be less than planted_hgt to be planted
#' @param id_gap_trees TRUE = use whether the plot id falls within a known gap to determine whether
#' it was planted or not
#' @param use_standard TRUE = standard dbh-height allometry, FALSE = residual dbh-height allometry
#' @param use_size TRUE = use the DBH of the tree in this measurement year to determine whether it
#' was planted or not
#' @param use_cc  TRUE = use whether the tree was in a clear cut to determine whether it is planted
#' or not
#'
#' @details
#' the use size parameter is a simple way to not overestimate the height of planted spruce,
#' (to differentiate planted vs residual spruce).
#'
#' The planted trees are only 26 years old in 201x and 30 years old in 2022,
#' so they werenâ€™t over 20 m tall yet whereas residual spruce trees mostly were canopy height.
#' Then for the heavy treatments any spruce <20 cm dbh were likely growing in gap cuts and
#' larger trees were likely  residual trees
